# How to Use This File (Claude)
- This document is **the single source of truth** for sprint tasks.
- Each task has a **stable ID** like `SP-001` and a **state**: `TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`.
- Mark progress by changing the state and checkbox:
  - `- [ ] (TODO) ...` → `- [/] (IN_PROGRESS) ...` → `- [x] (DONE) ...`
- Only modify within the **BEGIN/END** markers.
- Keep IDs stable; do **not** renumber.
- Update **status_summary** counters at the top.
- After each change, append a short note to **Changelog** with date and affected IDs.
- After each sprint has finished record summary in the **Summary** section of each sprint and update the **Next Steps**

## States Legend
- [ ] (TODO)       — not started
- [/] (IN_PROGRESS) — work started
- [x] (DONE)       — coded, compiled, basic test passed

# Dependencies

## Critical Path Dependencies
- SP-003 (compilation fixes) blocks all other work
- SP-011 (scene creation) blocks SP-012 through SP-020
- SP-021 (main menu) blocks SP-022 through SP-030
- SP-031 (audio manager) blocks SP-032 through SP-040
- SP-071 (build pipeline) depends on most other tasks completing

## Parallel Work Opportunities
- Audio content (Sprint 4) can be prepared during Sprint 3
- Tutorial design (Sprint 7) can be planned during Sprint 5-6
- Build pipeline setup (Sprint 8) can begin during Sprint 6
- UI design work can overlap with scene creation

## System Integration Points
- SaveSystem must integrate with all new UI systems
- AudioManager must connect to all interactive systems
- PermanentUpgradeSystem affects player stats and UI
- DynamicObjectiveSystem needs UI integration
- Tutorial system must integrate with all core mechanics

---

# Acceptance Criteria Notes
- "No compilation errors" = Unity console completely clean on play
- "Maintains >30 FPS" = stable framerate with 20+ Guards, 30+ Citizens active
- "All game state clearly visible" = player never confused about progress/status
- "Smooth transitions" = no loading hitches, state preserved
- "Works on minimum specs" = GTX 1060, 8GB RAM, i5-8400 or equivalent

---

# Risk Mitigation

## High-Risk Items
1. **Performance with full scene** (SP-004, SP-018) - Early stress testing required
2. **AI pathfinding at scale** (SP-013, SP-053) - Complex navigation with many NPCs
3. **Save/load with complex state** (SP-051) - Many interconnected systems to persist
4. **Audio system integration** (SP-031-SP-039) - New system touching many components

## Mitigation Strategies
- Performance testing early and often (Sprint 1)
- Incremental scene building with constant testing (Sprint 2)
- Save/load testing after every major system addition
- Audio implementation with fallback/graceful degradation
