 * OBJECT POOLING SYSTEM SUMMARY
 * =============================
 * 
 * OVERVIEW:
 * ---------
 * The object pooling system provides efficient object spawning and management for the vampire game.
 * It reduces garbage collection, improves performance, and provides better memory management.
 *

 *    - Generic object pooling system
 *    - Singleton pattern for global access
 *    - Automatic pool expansion
 *    - Statistics tracking
 *    - Debug logging and context menu options
 * 
 * 2. PooledSpawner (PooledSpawner.cs)
 *    - Specialized spawner for entities (guards, citizens, etc.)
 *    - Waypoint-based spawning
 *    - Area-based spawning
 *    - Batch spawning capabilities
 *    - Entity initialization and personality assignment
 * 
 * 3. ProjectilePool (ProjectilePool.cs)
 *    - Specialized pool for projectiles and effects
 *    - Auto-return functionality
 *    - Trail renderer support
 *    - Particle system integration
 *    - Specialized spawning methods for different projectile types
 * 
 * 4. EnhancedSpawner Integration
 *    - Updated to use object pooling
 *    - Backward compatibility with direct instantiation
 *    - Automatic pool initialization
 *    - Entity return functionality
 * 
 * 5. PooledObjectComponent (in ObjectPool.cs)
 *    - Component for tracking pooled objects
 *    - Auto-return functionality
 *    - Activation/deactivation callbacks
 * 
 * FEATURES:
 * ---------
 * 
 * Performance Optimization:
 * - Reduces garbage collection frequency
 * - Faster object creation/destruction
 * - Better memory management
 * - Improved frame rate stability
 * 
 * Flexibility:
 * - Configurable pool sizes
 * - Expandable pools
 * - Auto-return functionality
 * - Fallback to direct instantiation
 * 
 * Debugging:
 * - Comprehensive statistics tracking
 * - Debug logging options
 * - Context menu utilities
 * - Pool monitoring
 * 
 * Integration:
 * - Seamless integration with existing systems
 * - Backward compatibility
 * - Easy migration path
 * - Comprehensive setup guide
 * 
 * USAGE PATTERNS:
 * ---------------
 * 
 * Entity Spawning:
 * - Use PooledSpawner for guards, citizens, and other entities
 * - Automatic initialization and personality assignment
 * - Waypoint and area-based spawning
 * - Batch spawning for multiple entities
 * 
 * Projectile Spawning:
 * - Use ProjectilePool for projectiles and effects
 * - Specialized methods for different projectile types
 * - Auto-return based on lifetime or particle system duration
 * - Trail renderer and audio integration
 * 
 * Direct Pool Access:
 * - Use ObjectPool.Instance for direct pool access
 * - Manual object retrieval and return
 * - Pool statistics and monitoring
 * - Pool management utilities
 * 
 * BENEFITS:
 * ---------
 * 
 * Performance:
 * - Reduced garbage collection pauses
 * - Faster object instantiation
 * - Better memory utilization
 * - Improved frame rate consistency
 * 
 * Scalability:
 * - Handles large numbers of objects efficiently
 * - Configurable pool sizes for different object types
 * - Automatic pool expansion when needed
 * - Memory-efficient object reuse
 * 
 * Maintainability:
 * - Centralized object management
 * - Consistent spawning patterns
 * - Easy debugging and monitoring
 * - Comprehensive documentation
 * 
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * -------------------
 * 
 * Existing Systems:
 * - EnhancedSpawner: Updated to use object pooling
 * - VampireHunter: Can use ProjectilePool for weapons
 * - GameManager: Can manage pool lifecycle
 * - SaveSystem: Pool state can be saved/restored
 * 
 * Future Systems:
 * - Any new spawner can use the pool system
 * - New projectile types can be added to ProjectilePool
 * - Effect systems can use the pool for particles
 * - UI systems can pool UI elements
 * 
 * SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
 * -------------------
 * 
 * Scene Setup:
 * - ObjectPool GameObject with ObjectPool component
 * - PooledSpawner GameObject with PooledSpawner component
 * - ProjectilePool GameObject with ProjectilePool component
 * - ObjectPoolingSetupGuide for automatic setup
 * 
 * Prefab Configuration:
 * - Unique prefab names (used as pool identifiers)
 * - PooledObjectComponent for auto-return functionality
 * - Proper initialization components
 * - Appropriate pool size configuration
 * 
 * Configuration:
 * - Initial pool sizes for each object type
 * - Maximum pool sizes to prevent memory issues
 * - Auto-return delays for projectiles and effects
 * - Debug and logging options
 * 
 * MIGRATION GUIDE:
 * ----------------
 * 
 * From Direct Instantiation:
 * 1. Replace Instantiate() calls with pool.GetObject()
 * 2. Replace Destroy() calls with pool.ReturnObject()
 * 3. Update spawner components to use pool system
 * 4. Configure pool sizes and settings
 * 
 * From Existing Spawners:
 * 1. Update spawner to use ObjectPool.Instance
 * 2. Configure entity pools in spawner
 * 3. Update initialization methods
 * 4. Test and adjust pool sizes
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * ---------------------------
 * 
 * Pool Sizing:
 * - Too small: Frequent pool expansion, performance impact
 * - Too large: Memory waste, longer initialization
 * - Optimal: Based on expected concurrent objects
 * 
 * Object Lifecycle:
 * - Short-lived objects: Use auto-return
 * - Long-lived objects: Manual return
 * - Mixed usage: Configure appropriately
 * 
 * Memory Management:
 * - Monitor pool sizes during gameplay
 * - Adjust pool sizes based on usage patterns
 * - Use pool statistics to optimize configuration
 * 
 * DEBUGGING TIPS:
 * ---------------
 * 
 * Common Issues:
 * - "Pool not found": Check prefab names and pool initialization
 * - "Pool empty": Increase pool size or check object return
 * - Performance issues: Monitor pool statistics and adjust sizes
 * - Memory leaks: Ensure objects are properly returned to pools
 * 
 * Debug Tools:
 * - Enable debugMode for detailed logging
 * - Use context menu options for statistics
 * - Monitor pool sizes in runtime
 * - Check object lifecycle with debug logs
 * 
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
 * --------------------
 * 
 * Potential Features:
 * - Pool preloading for faster startup
 * - Dynamic pool sizing based on usage
 * - Pool pooling for very large systems
 * - Network synchronization for multiplayer
 * - Advanced statistics and analytics
 * 
 * Integration Opportunities:
 * - Unity's new Object Pooling system
 * - Addressable Assets for dynamic loading
 * - ECS integration for large-scale systems
 * - Custom editor tools for pool management
