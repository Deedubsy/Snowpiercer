/// AI Improvements Summary
/// 
/// This document outlines the major improvements made to the GuardAI and Citizen AI systems
/// to create more realistic, dynamic, and engaging gameplay.
/// 
/// ========================================
/// GUARD AI IMPROVEMENTS
/// ========================================
/// 
/// 1. ADVANCED SEARCH BEHAVIOR
///    - Multi-point search patterns using spiral generation
///    - Investigation time at each search point
///    - Proper NavMesh integration for search points
///    - Search completion and return to patrol
/// 
/// 2. GUARD COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
///    - Guards communicate with nearby guards when alert
///    - Share player position information
///    - Guards can respond to alerts from other guards
///    - Configurable communication range
/// 
/// 3. VISUAL FEEDBACK SYSTEM
///    - Dynamic light colors based on guard state
///    - Green = Patrol, Red = Chase, Yellow = Alert
///    - Light intensity changes with state
///    - Easy visual identification of guard status
/// 
/// 4. AUDIO FEEDBACK SYSTEM
///    - Detection sounds when player spotted
///    - Alert sounds when entering alert mode
///    - Search sounds during investigation
///    - Communication sounds between guards
/// 
/// 5. IMPROVED STATE MANAGEMENT
///    - Proper state transitions with effects
///    - Visual and audio feedback on state changes
///    - Better integration with alertness system
/// 
/// ========================================
/// CITIZEN AI IMPROVEMENTS
/// ========================================
/// 
/// 1. PERSONALITY SYSTEM
///    - 6 different personality types: Cowardly, Normal, Brave, Curious, Social, Loner
///    - Personality affects detection speed and behavior
///    - Cowardly citizens detect faster and run more
///    - Brave citizens are less easily startled
///    - Curious citizens investigate unusual things
/// 
/// 2. MEMORY SYSTEM
///    - Citizens remember important events
///    - Memory types: Player sightings, noises, lights, social interactions, threats
///    - Memory importance affects retention time
///    - Memory decay over time
///    - Limited memory slots with priority system
/// 
/// 3. SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
///    - Citizens interact with nearby citizens
///    - Share memories and information
///    - Face each other during interactions
///    - Social level affects interaction frequency
///    - Loners avoid social interactions
/// 
/// 4. ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS
///    - React to noises in the environment
///    - Personality affects noise reactions
///    - Cowardly citizens flee from noises
///    - Curious/Brave citizens investigate noises
///    - React to light changes (framework for future integration)
/// 
/// 5. VISUAL FEEDBACK SYSTEM
///    - Dynamic light colors based on citizen state
///    - White = Normal, Yellow = Alert, Red = Scared, Blue = Social
///    - Light intensity changes with state
///    - Easy visual identification of citizen status
/// 
/// 6. AUDIO FEEDBACK SYSTEM
///    - Alert sounds when detecting player
///    - Scared sounds for cowardly reactions
///    - Social sounds during interactions
/// 
/// ========================================
/// INTEGRATION FEATURES
/// ========================================
/// 
/// 1. ALERTNESS SYSTEM INTEGRATION
///    - Both systems properly integrate with GuardAlertnessManager
///    - Guards notify alertness manager when spotting player
///    - Citizens contribute to alertness through guard alerts
/// 
/// 2. RANDOM EVENT INTEGRATION
///    - Both systems respond to random events
///    - Speed multipliers and behavior changes
///    - Proper reversion when events end
/// 
/// 3. SCHEDULE SYSTEM INTEGRATION
///    - Citizens integrate with CitizenScheduleManager
///    - Proper waypoint group switching
///    - Sleep/wake behavior
/// 
/// ========================================
/// SETUP REQUIREMENTS
/// ========================================
/// 
/// GUARD SETUP:
/// - Add Light component for visual feedback
/// - Add AudioSource component for audio feedback
/// - Set up audio clips for different states
/// - Configure communication range and search settings
/// - Ensure guards are on "Guard" layer for communication
/// 
/// CITIZEN SETUP:
/// - Add Light component for visual feedback
/// - Add AudioSource component for audio feedback
/// - Set up audio clips for different states
/// - Configure personality traits and behavior levels
/// - Set up memory system parameters
/// - Configure social interaction settings
/// 
/// ========================================
/// BALANCING CONSIDERATIONS
/// ========================================
/// 
/// 1. DETECTION BALANCE
///    - Personality modifiers affect difficulty
///    - Memory system can make citizens more aware over time
///    - Social sharing can spread information quickly
/// 
/// 2. COMMUNICATION BALANCE
///    - Guard communication can create cascading alerts
///    - Communication range affects coordination
///    - Consider limiting communication frequency
/// 
/// 3. MEMORY BALANCE
///    - Memory decay time affects long-term awareness
///    - Memory importance affects information sharing
///    - Memory slots limit information retention
/// 
/// 4. SOCIAL BALANCE
///    - Social interaction frequency affects information spread
///    - Social range affects how quickly information spreads
///    - Personality distribution affects overall difficulty
/// 
/// ========================================
/// FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
/// ========================================
/// 
/// 1. NOISE SYSTEM
///    - Implement comprehensive noise detection
///    - Different noise types (footsteps, doors, traps)
///    - Noise propagation through environment
/// 
/// 2. LIGHTING SYSTEM
///    - Dynamic lighting awareness
///    - Shadow detection and reaction
///    - Light source tracking
/// 
/// 3. ADVANCED PATROL PATTERNS
///    - Dynamic patrol route generation
///    - Cover-based movement
///    - Formation-based patrolling
/// 
/// 4. EMOTIONAL STATES
///    - Fear, anger, confusion states
///    - Emotional state affects behavior
///    - Emotional contagion between NPCs
/// 
/// 5. LEARNING SYSTEM
///    - NPCs learn from repeated encounters
///    - Adaptation to player tactics
///    - Pattern recognition and counter-strategies
