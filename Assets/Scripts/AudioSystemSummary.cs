 * 
 * SETUP REQUIREMENTS:
 * -------------------
 * 
 * Audio Assets:
 * - Music tracks for different times and moods
 * - Sound effects for player actions and interactions
 * - Ambient sounds for environmental immersion
 * - UI sounds for interface feedback
 * - Voice lines for characters (future)
 * 
 * Audio Mixer:
 * - Master volume control
 * - Individual group controls (Music, SFX, Ambient, UI)
 * - Dynamic parameters for real-time mixing
 * - Audio effects (reverb, echo, filters)
 * 
 * Configuration:
 * - Pool sizes for different audio types
 * - Trigger conditions and ranges
 * - Volume levels and fade times
 * - Spatial audio settings
 * 
 * MIGRATION GUIDE:
 * ----------------
 * 
 * From Basic Audio:
 * 1. Replace direct AudioSource usage with AudioManager
 * 2. Configure audio pools for frequently used sounds
 * 3. Set up audio triggers for environmental sounds
 * 4. Implement dynamic audio mixing
 * 
 * From Existing Audio Systems:
 * 1. Integrate with AudioManager for centralized control
 * 2. Add AudioMixerController for dynamic mixing
 * 3. Configure audio triggers for environmental audio
 * 4. Set up performance optimization through pooling
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * ---------------------------
 * 
 * Audio Pooling:
 * - Configure appropriate pool sizes for your game
 * - Monitor pool usage and adjust as needed
 * - Use audio pooling for frequently played sounds
 * - Balance memory usage with performance
 * 
 * Spatial Audio:
 * - Limit the number of simultaneous spatial audio sources
 * - Use appropriate max distances for audio sources
 * - Consider culling distant audio sources
 * - Optimize spatial blend settings
 * 
 * Memory Management:
 * - Compress audio files appropriately
 * - Use streaming for large music files
 * - Monitor audio memory usage
 * - Clean up unused audio sources
 * 
 * DEBUGGING TIPS:
 * ---------------
 * 
 * Common Issues:
 * - "Audio clip not found": Check clip names and assignments
 * - "Pool empty": Increase pool sizes or check object return
 * - "No spatial audio": Check spatial blend and distance settings
 * - "Volume issues": Check mixer group assignments and volume levels
 * 
 * Debug Tools:
 * - Enable debugMode for detailed logging
 * - Use context menu options for testing
 * - Monitor audio statistics in runtime
 * - Visualize trigger areas with gizmos
 * 
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
 * --------------------
 * 
 * Potential Features:
 * - Advanced audio effects and filters
 * - Procedural audio generation
 * - Audio-driven gameplay mechanics
 * - Voice recognition and synthesis
 * - Advanced spatial audio (HRTF, ambisonics)
 * 
 * Integration Opportunities:
 * - Unity's new Audio System
 * - Wwise or FMOD integration
 * - VR audio support
 * - Mobile audio optimization
 * - Cloud audio processing
