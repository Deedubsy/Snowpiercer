/// This script provides a summary of the Comprehensive Error Logging system.
///
/// === DESCRIPTION ===
/// The Comprehensive Error Logging system is a custom-built solution designed to replace and
/// enhance Unity's default logging capabilities. It provides developers with more control over
/// how log information is captured, displayed, and stored, which is critical for debugging
/// both in the editor and in standalone builds.
///
/// === CORE COMPONENTS ===
///
/// 1.  GameLogger.cs:
///     - The central singleton that manages all logging functionality.
///     - It processes a queue of log messages asynchronously to minimize performance impact.
///     - It is responsible for dispatching logs to the Unity console and a text file.
///     - Provides static methods for easy access from any script (e.g., `GameLogger.LogWarning(...)`).
///
/// 2.  InGameDebugConsole.cs:
///     - An optional but highly recommended UI component that displays logs in real-time within the game.
///     - It is automatically instantiated and managed by the GameLogger.
///     - Allows for toggling visibility with a hotkey and filtering logs by their severity level.
///
/// 3.  ErrorLoggingSetupGuide.cs:
///     - An editor-only script that provides detailed instructions and a verification tool
///       to ensure the system is correctly integrated into a scene.
///
/// === KEY CONCEPTS AND DATA STRUCTURES ===
///
/// -   Log Levels (Enum): `Info`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Critical`. Each level has a severity, allowing for
///     hierarchical filtering. For example, setting the log level to 'Warning' will show warnings,
///     errors, and critical messages, but hide info.
///
/// -   Log Categories (Enum): `AI`, `Audio`, `Gameplay`, `System`, etc. These tags provide context
///     to log messages, making it easier to trace issues back to specific game systems.
///
/// -   LogMessage (Struct): A data structure that encapsulates all information for a single log entry,
///     including its timestamp, level, category, message content, and an optional context object.
///
/// === WORKFLOW ===
///
/// 1.  Setup: A `GameLogger` GameObject is added to the main scene, with the `GameLogger` and
///     `InGameDebugConsole` scripts attached.
///
/// 2.  Logging: Scripts throughout the project call static methods like `GameLogger.Log(...)` or
///     `GameLogger.LogError(...)` to record events.
///
/// 3.  Queueing: The `GameLogger` receives these calls and places a `LogMessage` struct into a queue.
///
/// 4.  Processing: In its `Update` loop, the `GameLogger` dequeues messages and processes them based
///     on the configured settings.
///
/// 5.  Dispatch: The message is sent to three potential outputs:
///     - Unity Console: If the message's level is at or above `consoleLogLevel`.
///     - Log File: If file logging is enabled and the level is at or above `fileLogLevel`.
///     - In-Game Console: An event is fired, which the `InGameDebugConsole` listens for to update its display.
///
/// This architecture ensures that logging is both flexible and performant, providing invaluable
/// insight during development and post-release support.
